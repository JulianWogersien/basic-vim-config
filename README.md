# basic-vim-config
basic vim config for when you dont need a full ide. contains no plugins and very little keybinds

control and arrows resize the current buffer
control and hjkl move between buffers
the :term command splits the terminal below instead of at the top
the colorscheme used is molokai
feel free to add things via PR but unless you make a good reason i wont accept plugins or very complex things

## keybinds
your leader key is ','
if you try to use the 'term' command vim will change it to 'bel term' which will
open the terminal at the bottom instead of at the top
navigate around buffers with control jkhl keys
resize current buffers by using control and arrow keys
